// build tooling (e.g. `next build` collecting route metadata) imports route

// query, so an eager throw on a missing DATABASE_URL would break the build
// itself rather than surfacing at actual request time, where it belongs.

  // Tuned for the site4now shared-hosting MySQL, which enforces
  // wait_timeout=30s and max_user_connections=20: any connection idle longer
  // than 30s is killed server-side, and a pool that keeps many idle sockets
  // around hands out dead ones — the source of the intermittent "Failed
  // query" errors. connectionLimit:10 (tried previously to give headroom for
  // the homepage's several parallel queries) ended up holding too many
  // connections against the host's tight 20-connection cap, so this was
  // pulled down to connectionLimit:2 — but that turned out too tight: a
  // single homepage render fires far more than 2 concurrent queries (hero
  // slides, categories, best sellers, store products — several of which do
  // multiple sequential round-trips internally), so most of them piled up
  // waiting for one of 2 connections and started tripping the 12s
  // withDbTimeout race (see db-timeout.ts) — the actual cause of renders,
  // including a plain language switch, appearing to hang. connectionLimit:5
  // gives enough headroom for one dev/prod process's own concurrent queries
  // while still leaving comfortable room under the host's 20-connection cap
  // if something else is sharing it. maxIdle:1 still recycles idle sockets
  // aggressively so they don't sit around and get killed server-side, and
  // queueLimit:0 (unbounded) lets excess queries queue for a free connection
  // rather than being rejected outright.
