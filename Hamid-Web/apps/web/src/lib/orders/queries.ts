/**
 * Guest orders are looked up by order number alone (the standard "guest order
 * tracking" pattern — no session exists to check ownership against). This
 * still applies even when the order has a customerId: a guest who checked
 * out with an email gets an account auto-created for them (see
 * resolveOrCreateGuestCustomer in checkout/actions.ts) without ever signing
 * in, so `customerId` alone doesn't mean "requires a session" anymore.
 *
 * Ownership is only enforced when someone IS signed in — a logged-in
 * customer can't browse another customer's order by guessing numbers, but an
 * anonymous visitor can always view an order by its number (same as before
 * guest-to-account auto-creation existed).
